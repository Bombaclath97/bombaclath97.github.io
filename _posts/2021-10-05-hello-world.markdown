## "Hello, World!\n" indeed!
I finally did it. I now officially have a portfolio/logbook/online-notepad!\
\
I tried so many times to commit to the idea of starting something like this. You may (not) be wondering why do I need a personal website in the first place. Oh do I have an answer to that: 

- To actually have somewhere to store all the stuff I will eventually forget *(memory is not my forte)*;
- If this actually fills with content, I basically have a business card ready everywhere I go;
- I can practice writing in English (and actually show my skills to the internet);
- To remember how to do what (and help others) in CTFs, Wargames and so on, in the form of writeups;
- To talk about videogames (when I want to);
- Finally, to have something to cringe to when I will be old.

# People that I look up to
A list of the people that made me want to get better at developing by being far more knowledgeable, smarter and faster than me. Basically, blame them for this shitty blog. Links are to their github pages.

I want to take advantage of the opportunity to tell you, no matter if you are a colleague, a friend, a random internet user or the future me: **thank you for the visit**, and since this is my first blog post ever, **Hello World!\n**
